Here is a structured outline and explanation for your diabetes risk calculator program, including the problem statement, project scope, target users, and high-level features.

#Problem Statement
Diabetes is a growing health problem worldwide, often going undetected until complications arise. Early identification of individuals at risk for diabetes can help prevent or delay onset through lifestyle interventions. The purpose of this calculator is to quickly evaluate personal risk factors and give a simple risk classification (low, moderate, or high), allowing users to take proactive steps and consult healthcare professionals as needed.​

#Scope of the Project
This project focuses on providing a user-friendly, command-line tool to estimate an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on common, easily measurable parameters. The calculator uses self-reported data and yields a score with a risk category, allowing anyone to assess their diabetes risk in a few minutes. The scope does not cover diagnosis, medical advice, or advanced laboratory parameters, but supports public health awareness and early risk identification.
​
#Target Users
Adults concerned about their risk for type 2 diabetes, especially those with risk factors.​
People with a family history of diabetes or chronic health conditions (such as hypertension or overweight).​
Healthcare providers seeking a quick screening tool for patients in community or clinical settings.​
Public health organizations looking to promote diabetes awareness and prevention.​

#High-Level Features
Simple input prompts for age, weight, height, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, family history, and physical activity.​
Automatic calculation of BMI from height and weight.​
Structured, readable output for user interpretation; suitable for both personal and clinical use.​
This structure helps clarify what the program does, whom it serves, and the essential features expected for a basic diabetes risk prediction tool. Each section is informed by current standards and online tools developed for similar purposes.
Scoring algorithm based on risk factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, glucose, family history, and physical activity.​

Clear categorization of diabetes risk (low, moderate, high) with immediate feedback to the user
